A tool that allows to import previously installed games, mostly useful when they disappeared from the library after a reinstall

1. Pick a folder and click Scan to search for Epic Game entries in all subfolders.
2. Select all games and click Import to add all found games to your Epic Games Launcher library.

When you open the Epic Game Launcher afterwards and go into your library, it will take a little while to scan, validate, and fix missing metadata for every game you just added.

# This repo was forked from https://github.com/FFouetil/EpicGamesImportTool. It was a little broken, so I fixed it (by randomly adding some imports in the C# files) and provided propper binaries in a zip file. All credit goes to FFouetil.
